4.File Path Issues ‚Äì PDF not found (uploads/sample.pdf vs data/sample.pdf)
5.500 Internal Server Error ‚Äì API crashed with unhandled exceptions
6.Agents Not Connected ‚Äì financial_analyst agent not properly bound to tasks
7.PDF Parsing Bug ‚Äì empty text returned for some PDFs
8.Unstructured API Response ‚Äì JSON output was inconsistent and unclear

## After Debugging (Fixes Applied)

## Project Overview
A comprehensive financial document analysis system that processes corporate reports, financial statements, and investment documents using AI-powered analysis agents.


## Getting Started

### Install Required Libraries
```sh
pip install -r requirement.txt
```

### Sample Document
The system analyzes financial documents like Tesla's Q2 2025 financial update.

**To add Tesla's financial document:**
1. Download the Tesla Q2 2025 update from: https://www.tesla.com/sites/default/files/downloads/TSLA-Q2-2025-Update.pdf
2. Save it as `data/sample.pdf` in the project directory
3. Or upload any financial PDF through the API endpoint

**Note:** Current `data/sample.pdf` is a placeholder - replace with actual Tesla financial document for proper testing.
